# Linkle - Wordle Spinoff

## Overview
This web application allows you to play a game of Linkle which is a spinoff of the popular game, Wordle. All words come from the video game series, *The Legend of Zelda*. You must figure out the 5 letter word by making up to 6 guesses. After each guess, each letter will be highlighted a certain color meaning different things:
- Gray - The letter is not used in the word
- Yellow - The letter is in the word, but is not in the correct place
- Green - The letter is in the correct place
